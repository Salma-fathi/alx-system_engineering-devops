# x13. Firewall Project

## Overview

This project focuses on configuring a firewall using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to secure servers by managing incoming and outgoing traffic effectively. The goal is to understand and implement essential firewall rules that protect servers from unauthorized access while allowing necessary services.



## Concepts

For this project, you are expected to understand:

- Web stack debugging

## Background Context

Your servers without a firewall are vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks. Implementing a firewall is crucial for maintaining security.

### Resources

- **Read or watch**: [What is a firewall](https://www.example.com)
- **Web stack debugging guide**: Allows you to check socket connectivity using tools like `telnet`.

### Example Commands

To check if a port is open on a server, you can use the following command:

```bash
telnet <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT>
