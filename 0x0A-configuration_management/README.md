# Project 0x0A: Configuration Management

This project focuses on configuration management, encompassing various aspects such as DevOps, SysAdmin, Scripting, and CI/CD. It utilizes Puppet for infrastructure management and task automation.

## Background Context

During my tenure at SlideShare, I contributed to an auto-remediation tool called Skynet, designed to monitor, scale, and fix Cloud infrastructure. Skynet leveraged MCollective, a parallel job-execution system, enabling the execution of commands across one or multiple servers simultaneously. However, a bug in the code resulted in unexpected consequences when 'nil' was sent to the filter method. This inadvertently led to the shutdown of SlideShare's entire document conversion environment, highlighting the importance of robust configuration management practices.
