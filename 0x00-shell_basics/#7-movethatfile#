Certainly! Here's a script that moves the file named `betty` from `/tmp/` to `/tmp/my_first_directory/`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory/
```

In the script above, the `mv` command is used to move the file `betty` from the `/tmp/` directory to the `/tmp/my_first_directory/` directory.

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste the script into the file.
3. Save the file with the desired name, such as `7-movethatfile`.
4. Make the script file executable by running the command: `chmod +x 7-movethatfile`.
5. Run the script using `source` or `./` (depending on your preference) to execute it in the current shell session:
   - Using `source`: `source 7-movethatfile`
   - Using `./`: `./7-movethatfile`

After running the script, the file `betty` will be moved from the `/tmp/` directory to the `/tmp/my_first_directory/` directory.

To verify the move, you can use the `ls` command to check the contents of the `/tmp/my_first_directory/` directory. Running `ls /tmp/my_first_directory/` should display the file `betty` in the output.

Please note that the actual output may vary depending on your system configuration.
